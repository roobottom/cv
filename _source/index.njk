{% set intro %}
{% markdown %}
I've been designing engaging online experiences since my 28K dial-up modem was a cutting-edge piece of kit. Nowadays, I work at the crossroads of creativity, design and technology. 

Most recently I've been designing services on <span class="sc">GOV.UK</span>. Before that, I built and led a design team. 

I'm also a skilled front-end developer; equally at home building prototypes as I am production code.
