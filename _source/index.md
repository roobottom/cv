### What I do

#### Design

My main focus is user-centred design. I'm well practiced in UX/UI design for digital products. More recently, I've stepped into service design. I'm excited by using the power of design thinking to solve whole-business problems.

What I'm trying to say:

- I have a lot of experience in digital design
- More recently I've been doing service design too
- The tools and techniques of UX can be used to solve other business problems, not just digital 
- I'm really interested in doing all this stuff. 

#### Lead

I'm interested in how designers work with others. I've built teams, designed processes and been a day-to-day manager. 

What I'm trying to say:

- I've built and led teams of designers in the past
- I would like to do this again
- I'm good at this as I have a wife understanding of what good design looks like (who you need, how they should work)

#### Code

I've been coding websites since 1998. Nowadays I use my coding skill as part of the design process. Whether it's creating a realistic prototype or building a design system, being able to code is immeasurably useful. 

What I'm trying to say:

- I've got loads of experience in coding for the web
- This is mega helpful for design. Things like creating prototypes and design systems. 
- I also do some front end coding for live sites and apps. 

#### Create

I believe that everyone is creative but most have forgotten how. By being deliberately creative, I help people rediscover their innate skill. I use a wide range of techniques to draw out the best—and often unexpected—ideas.

What I'm trying to say:

- Everyone is creative, but most have forgotten how
- I used some techniques to help people have better ideas
- This is often in workshops
