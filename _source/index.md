# Jon Roobottom's CV

## h2

I'm a designer with 20 years experience of making online services and products.

Born in the Black Country, I always wanted to follow my dad into a career in engineering. In fact, I studied electrical engineering at University. But a year in I discovered a love of design and switched my degree.

Now living by the sea in Sussex, I have a foot in both worlds: I bring a no-nonsense approach to the design process; a ton of practical, hands-on expertise in building things for the web; and systems-thinking in everything I do.

### Who I am

> What's it like to work with me? I wrote this section to help answer that question.

#### I'm a designer

I believe in a human-centred design approach. Testing an idea with real people by building low cost prototypes as early as possible. Fail fast and iterate quickly.

#### I'm a leader

I believe that the best solutions happen when teams work together. I seek to inspire collaborative problem solving whatever my role.

#### I'm a developer

I've been coding websites since 2001. I've led teams of developers and hand-built commercial websites and apps. Design is my first love but I'm also an adept web-developer with a deep understanding of how to build for the web.

#### I'm creative on purpose
