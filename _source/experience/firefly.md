I joined as the first designer when the company was four people in a tiny shared office space. During my time, I helped grow Firefly to over 500 client schools and 60 staff across three international offices. 

* I defined the research and design process
* I developed a design system
* I hired good people and helped them do their best work
* I helped grow the company to over 500 schools as a member of the senior leadership team
* I made an impact; “Design and functionality” were often top among the reasons quoted for schools renewing.
