When Firefly raised capital with the aim of rapid growth in the UK and internationally, I was asked to hire and lead a product design team. Over the next four years, alongside the other 'heads-of', we expanded the company to over 500 schools in 60 countries with around 250k users.

- I grew Firefly's design team from 1 (me) to 5
- I defined Firefly's research and design process
- I led the creation of Firefly's design system
- I embedded user-centred design across the whole organisation
- I helped lead the company as part of Firefly's SLT
