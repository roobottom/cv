When Firefly raised capital with the aim of rapid growth in the UK and internationally, I was asked to hire and lead a product design team. Over the next four years, alongside the other 'heads-of', we expanded the company to over 500 schools in 60 countries with around 250k users.

I was responsible for:

- Growing and mentoring Firefly's design team
- Owning Firefly's research and design process
- Leading the creation of Firefly's design system
- Embedding user-centred design across the organisation
- Advocating for user needs and helping to define the product strategy
