I helped Firefly grow from a start-up to an international company. We expanded from a handful in the UK to around a hundred schools worldwide. 

- I designed and built websites for schools
- Designed apps for iPhone and iPad
- Prototyped and built new app features for Firefly Web
- Conducted research with teachers and students 
- Helped to grow our community of schools by involving teachers and students in the design process.
